# Spring Boot Secure App with JWT Tokens and Batch Processing

This is a Spring Boot project that demonstrates my skills in securing applications using Spring Security 6 and JWT tokens. It also showcases the implementation of logout functionality, refresh tokens, enabling JPA auditing, and batch processing using Spring Batch.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following features and components:

- **Spring Boot**: The core framework used for developing the application.
- **Spring Security 6**: Used to implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the application.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Implemented as a means of authentication and validation for API endpoints.
- **Logout Functionality**: Implemented a secure logout mechanism to invalidate JWT tokens.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Implemented the use of refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens without requiring user credentials.
- **JPA Auditing**: Enabled JPA entity auditing to track creation and modification timestamps.
- **Spring Batch**: Demonstrated batch processing capabilities using Spring Batch.
